                    Before beginning an adventure, you lay out the contents of your bags, days or sometimes weeks in advance. Adding to the growing piles as the departure date draws nearer and often returning to the same pile of clothes, ticking off your mental checklist; 2 t-shirts, yes, 2, or maybe 3 pairs of socks, yes… Depending on the trip, some adventurers become obsessed by the idea of travelling super light, taking tips from people such a Sean Conway and sawing a toothbrush in half to save precious grams. One thing often omitted, or tossed away at the last minute to lay dejectedly in the maybe pile is a good adaptable shirt. The type of shirt that will allow you to accept invites to weddings, or get dressed up despite the other obvious tell-tale signs of having been on the road for quite some time. The shabby chic look of a traveller has its place, surrounded by Aussies trying to convince them that you too, are a ‘mad cunt…’. Sometimes, to break out of the hostel bubble, there are benefits of adapting to a more presentable version of yourself.

                    My first adventure was inter-railing around Europe in 2014 with my now house mate, Charlie. While that trip, and others after, allowed me to visit new places and learn about new cultures, I got the urge to explore a bit further, taking on a slower pace of life. I decided to try and travel by bike on a 6-month ride from Leeds, England to the city of Kashgar in eastern China. Cycling meant that everything I took with me resulted in more expended energy and more importantly, consumed calories. I had to make some crucial sacrifices. Where I would have previously played it safe packing the extra pair of socks, I didn’t allow myself this luxury. However one item firmly in the essentials pile, nestled between my tent and sleeping bag, was my trusty travelling shirt.

                    This shirt had been with me for all my previous trips, it is blue with brown, white and black lines forming a diamond checkerboard pattern. Crucially, it is made of a crease proof material, well at least that’s how I perceive it. Although admittedly my bar is quite low when it comes to ironing.

                    I am not alone in placing emphasis on the importance of a shirt, in fact, even within the niche circle of cyclists travelling from Europe to China in 2018 there was someone more pro- the trusty travelling shirts than me. Unfortunately, we never met but from what I could tell @cyclingsugarglider took his love for shirts pretty seriously. He wore one most days while on the bike, and to some weddings and raves along the way I’m sure. I admire that in a sport where most people squeeze into lycra to cut through the wind as efficiently as possible, his shirt did quite the opposite. Whether this was the anti-establishment statement I hoped it to be, I don’t know. However, it did result in one of the better Instagram handles, and accounts, out there.

                    My shirt had many wears and saw many sights, but the most memorable for me happened when I was cycling with Cody Moir. I first met Cody in Azerbaijan. We cycled across Kazakhstan together and at this point were nearing Samarkand, Uzbekistan, an ancient city which is the final resting place of Timur, founder of the Timurid Empire. Two days before reaching Samarkand, we stopped at a shop and chatted to some rather finely dressed men. They were relations of a groom who was due to get married that evening and extended the wedding invite to us. Despite not sharing a common language, I could tell they were concerned about our appearance. Before they had chance to play fairy godmother to our Cinderellas, I pulled out my trusty travelling shirt.

                    The wedding was amazing. In typical Uzbek style, which we had become accustomed to, it included a lot of vodka. I was unfortunately drinking for two, as Cody was not only wearing just a t-shirt, but he doesn’t drink. Some of the younger guests quickly worked that out and turned all their attention on me. I tried my best to please our hosts, but was starting to struggle. Luckily by this point, the central tables were being cleared and moved to one side which could only mean one thing…dancing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Sat in my favourite travelling shirt, I was raring to go. For the first hour or so the dance floor was only occupied only by women. Not wanting to step out of turn, I waited patiently for my opportunity. As the first few men joined, I grabbed Cody and we wandered over for a dance. The Uzbek music wasn’t what we were used to. However, thanks to the confidence of the shirt I quickly found my rhythm and floated around the dance floor, arm round a larger gentleman who had lost two fingers on his right hand. Cody wasn’t having the same luck, his t-shirt seemed to be weighing him down and he couldn’t break free of the rigid two step shackles he gained after 3 years living in Bristol.

                    <p>
                    The night of dancing came to an end and we were kindly offered somewhere to stay and some hot milk in the morning before getting on our way. It is these interactions with people, which are my main motivation to travel. The joy of knowing you will probably never have a similar experience again is rather remarkable. Despite the shirt’s crucial role in the story, I may have slightly exaggerated just how pivotal it was. It is people’s kindness that means that connections and experiences like these are possible. I have found that a smile is often all that is needed to connect with someone, but a shirt to go with a straggly beard can’t do any harm.

                    I was hoping to write a series of posts talking about the previous bikes I have owned, using them as a vehicle to delve into my memories of cycling, veering off on tangents seemingly leading nowhere before bringing it back to the bike and the lessons I learnt along the way. Seen as my dad is quarantining due to COVID, I asked if he was able to search the stacks of old photos in the house and dig out any of me on a bike which might help jog my memory. With parents as technophobic as mine, I shouldn’t have been too surprised when the only photos my dad could find of me were when I was between the ages of 0 and 10, coincidently coinciding with the end of film cameras and the advent of digital cameras to the mainstream.

                    Above, is one of the two pictures my dad managed to find, which unsurprisingly I have no memory of. However, he did mention that one of my first bike adventures would have been cycling from our family house, then in Thorp Arch, to Spofforth on the small red bike pictured. This 6.3 mile route, runs along the old Wetherby Railway, one of the UK’s many disused railway lines. The Wetherby railway closed in 1964, during the ‘Beeching Axe’ period, as a result of the Beeching report which led to the closure, demolition or sale of thousands of stations and miles of track. Thanks to organisations, such as Sustrans and local community groups, some 4500 miles of disused rail lines, including the Wetherby line, now provide space for pedestrians, joggers, cyclists and horse riders to explore.

                    This specific path, which gave me a safe haven to learn to cycle in the early 2000s, was later used by Marcelo Bielsa, the Leeds United manager from 2018 to 2022. Seemingly every day, except match days, he would commute on foot, from his home in Wetherby, to the Leeds United training ground, in Thorp Arch. During a stint of living at home and having taken up running, I was fortunate enough to pass the great man twice. The first time, I remained silent, smiled and picked up my pace, in an attempt to impress him, replicating his high tempo, hardworking playing style. For months after this encounter, I would spend time rehearsing what I would say, if I happened to see him again. I downloaded Duolingo and learnt pointless phrases, such as “El perro come pan”.

                    <p>
                    Being known for his philosophical mind and his deep socialist views, what I really should have asked him is what he thought about the consequence of the Beeching report. By ripping out the underperforming train network, people were left stranded, only to be served by a supposedly high-quality replacement bus service. Lacking any real foresight, what Beeching may have failed to recognise, is the effect the future popularity of the car would have on those now reliant on the road network. The closure of the Wetherby line and many others like it, has led to a cycle network unlike any others I have experienced elsewhere.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The cycle network across the UK includes tons of these old rail lines, canal paths and bridle ways. However much I would long for a train to save me wasting hours as a teenager riding the 770 in and out of town, just to stand near top McDonald’s on Brigette. I’m sure 7-year-old me was pretty happy with 6.3 miles of car free path, where me, my bike and my stabilisers were the only 4-wheeled vehicle I had to worry about.
